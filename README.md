- 👋 Hi, I’m @creasy64 and I'm a Retired Senior Computer Systems Analyst

- 👀 I’m interested in how I might fit in to a Developers Environment like Git and Github

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to start learning to do coding.  I've working in IT at every level and my son colaberates like this in the development of games.
          One of the games he developed was Minions of Mirth.  He said that I have lots of skills that will help me to become involved in projects where I'm needed.
          So I thought I would give this a try.  After stumbling apon it while doing something completely different.  LOL

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I might be able to help with.
